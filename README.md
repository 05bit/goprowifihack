This is a community effort to document the API calls between GoPro cameras and GoPro's Smartphone App via WiFi. It has 4 sections for each camera model:
- WiFi commands: a list of WiFi commands you can use for the camera.
- Livestreaming: methods of getting a live video feed off the camera.
- Media Browsing: Instructions on getting media off the SD card via wifi.
- Camera Status: List of camera status meanings

Note: HERO4 camera is now the *base* for the future API, since the calls will be the same for HERO4 and above.

### Regarding GoPro's official Developer Program

GoPro offers an official SDK for communicating with GoPro cameras, which can be used with a yearly subscription. This repository exists since November 11, 2013 and has been providing an up to date and free GoPro API for all WiFi Enabled models. This will continue to be the same. GoPro released their closed source and paid API in April 14, 2016. By the time, both companies and hobbyists have been using this API to get their products and services working with GoPro cameras.

This API will be updated as I get access to newly released cameras, if you are a company, I highly recommend to enroll in the GoPro developer program.
