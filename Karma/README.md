#GoPro Karma system

**Work In Progress**

Main goal is to hack the Passenger App and get the stream from the Karma Remote (possibly needing re-encoding) and streaming it somewhere else (YouTube, Livestream, Twitch...). Also controlling the camera (start/stop, settings, etc...) from the Passanger App URI calls.
